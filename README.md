# Recommendation System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
A customizable recommendation engine implementing both collaborative and content-based filtering approaches to suggest relevant items (movies, books, or products) based on user preferences.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Dual Recommendation Modes**:
  - Collaborative filtering (user-user similarity)
  - Content-based filtering (item attributes)
- **Preference Learning**:
  - Explicit ratings input
  - Implicit behavior tracking
- **Modular Design**:
  - Easy dataset swapping
  - Configurable similarity metrics

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Implemented
### Collaborative Filtering
```python
def user_similarity(user1, user2, ratings):
    # Pearson correlation implementation
    common_items = get_common_rated_items(user1, user2)
    n = len(common_items)
    if n == 0: return 0
    
    sum1 = sum(ratings[user1][item] for item in common_items)
    sum2 = sum(ratings[user2][item] for item in common_items)
    
    # Similarity calculation logic
    ...
def cosine_similarity(item1, item2, features):
    # TF-IDF weighted cosine similarity
    dot_product = sum(features[item1][f] * features[item2][f] for f in features[item1])
    magnitude = (sum(f**2 for f in features[item1].values())**0.5) * 
                (sum(f**2 for f in features[item2].values())**0.5)
    return dot_product / magnitude if magnitude != 0 else 0
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Python packages: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

### Installation
1. Download the project files
2. Install required packages using pip

### Usage
1. Prepare your data with user ratings and item features
2. Run the recommendation engine script
3. Select your preferred recommendation method
4. Receive personalized suggestions

## Customization Options
Adjust these parameters in the code:
- Similarity calculation method
- Number of recommendations to generate
- Weighting between different recommendation approaches

## Future Enhancements
